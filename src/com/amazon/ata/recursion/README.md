## Recursion - AtaLinkedList

### Logistics

**Branch name: recursion-classroom**

**RDE workflow**:
* Completion
  * `rde workflow run recursion-classroom-phase0`
  * `rde workflow run recursion-classroom-sum`
  * `rde workflow run recursion-classroom-reverse`
* Extensions
  * `rde workflow run recursion-classroom-size`
  * `rde workflow run recursion-classroom-contains`
  * `rde workflow run recursion-classroom-max`
  * `rde workflow run recursion-classroom-hashcode`
  * `rde workflow run recursion-classroom-equals`

### Phase 0: Make sure it's working

Run workflow `recursion-classroom-phase0`. These tests should all pass.

### GILA

Follow the instructions in the GILA document for what to
implement and what workflows to run when.
